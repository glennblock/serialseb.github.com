# Speaker bios
Here you can find a few bios you can use for your conference, in different styles and oriented on different aspects
of the services I offer.

## Web / ReST
Sebastien Lambla runs Caffeine IT, a consultancy helping clients from all over Europe implement first-grade and
nnovative solutions, from brushing up software design skills to implementing enterprise-ready resource-oriented
architectures.
In his spare time, Sebastien writes a book on ReST, contributes to OSS projects, and is still in a secret love affair
with javascript and nodejs.
