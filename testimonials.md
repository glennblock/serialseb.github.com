> Sebastien delivered an outstanding session about RESTful API:s and hypermedia during Øredev 2011. But what's equally
> important - he really took the time to hang around the conference talking and debating with any attendee that
> approached him. This is what makes a conference great, speakers, like Sebastien, that takes the time to have all those
> discussions between the sessions.

Colin Jack, developer

> Sebastien Lambla is purely brilliant! Not only is he extremely talented, but he is hard working and always well
> prepared and innovative. Most of the projects I had the pleasure of working with him on involved highly complex
> scenarios that were all presenting high risks. Sebastien always came to the table with innovative solutions that not
> only looked amazing, but worked perfectly. I would work with him again without hesitation.
