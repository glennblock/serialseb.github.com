title: Building hypermedia applications (workshop)
description: |
    Building a ReSTful service can be challenging, and deciding how to build an API often dictates how client
    applications are built. In this workshop, weâ€™ll start from a typical client consuming a json API, and through the
    use of links, forms and late binding, see how we can build our applications more like browsers, unleashing the
    power of hypermedia to reduce complexity and coupling.
