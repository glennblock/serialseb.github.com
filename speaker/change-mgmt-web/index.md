title: Versions are evil - Doing without them in your web API
layout: talk
description: |
    People change. And when you don't recognize them anymore, sometimes you'd be right in thinking they're just not the
    same person. APIs are the same, adding a version is the hard drug of web APIs, the first hit is free but you're
    going to pay later!
    We'll explore in practice what is wrong with versioning, and how we can manage change in our APIs
    over time without the need for them.
